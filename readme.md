##### Steps to run

Download and unzip data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
It should end up on a folder called: "UCI HAR Dataset", so that the path to some of the files used looks like the following:

- //UCI HAR Dataset//train//subject_train.txt
- //UCI HAR Dataset//test//subject_test.txt
- //UCI HAR Dataset//train//X_train.txt

Place the "run_analysis.R" at the same folder where you unzipped the "UCI HAR Dataset"

Open "run_analysis.R" with RStudio and set the Working Directory to the folder where "run_analysis.R" is located at. (hint: use setWd("some folder here"))

Use RStudio to run the code on run_analysis.R.

Two files will created as output: step5.txt and step4.txt
